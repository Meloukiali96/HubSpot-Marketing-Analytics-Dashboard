# HubSpot Marketing Analytics Dashboard
![Dashboard Preview](dashboard/Hubspot Marketing Analytics Dashboard Screenshot.jpg)

## Project Overview  
This project is a Power BI dashboard I built using marketing data from **HubSpot CRM** stored in **Snowflake**.  
The goal was to track the full marketing funnel â€” from leads to deals to closed wins â€” and see how campaigns, customer segments, and geography influence revenue.  

I treated this as if I were delivering insights for a marketing and sales team: keep it simple, visual, and actionable.

## Why I Built This  
I wanted to:  
- Practice connecting real CRM data from HubSpot into Snowflake and then into Power BI.  
- Create a professional-looking dashboard that recruiters and hiring managers can immediately understand.  
- Answer real business questions:  
  - Which campaigns bring the most conversions?  
  - Which countries generate the most revenue?  
  - How does income level affect average deal size?

## Tools & Data  
- **HubSpot CRM** â†’ Deals, Contacts, Campaign/Email data.  
- **Snowflake** â†’ Used to store and query the raw CSVs before connecting to Power BI.  
- **Power BI** â†’ For all visualizations, KPIs, and filters.

## Dashboard Features
